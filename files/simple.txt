The cat ran fast to the big red door, but the dog was near so it had to stop. It sat and saw a bird fly up high in the sky. The sun was hot, and the air was dry. A boy and a girl went to play with a ball. They hit the ball to the left, then to the right. Soon it got dark, and they had to go home. The moon was out, and stars were bright. The cat went to sleep near a small tree. The wind made a soft sound. The dog barked once, but then went back to sleep. In the house, the boy had a book. He read each word slow. His mom made warm tea and sat by him. They did not talk, just read. The girl had a toy bear and held it tight. The clock on the wall made a tick-tock sound. The night was calm. The next day, the sun came back. The kids ran out to play. The cat sat near the door. It was a good day.
